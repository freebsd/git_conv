# How the earlier CVS history is being rewritten

The cvs2svn conversion sprayed several revisions onto multiple branches only to
then merge all the changes into head in the next revision. This might be
technically correct in terms of CVS tags, but often these tags were only used
once, or with different spellings. True branches like
`cvs2svn/branches/MACKERAS` are actually where vendor/pppd was initially
imported. `cvs2svn/branches/HUGH_F_MAHON` is were ee(1) initially was imported.

Some imports like r1578 imported regex.c with the "branch" `UofM_at_CP` which
then was never reused.

What's more, all the cvs2svn branches and tags were later deleted, deemed of
little value.

## Vendor branches of questionable use

Some branches were reused quite a bit in the early days, though.

*  vendor/CSRG/dist saw commits till r41472 and was frequently merged to head
*  vendor/misc-GNU/dist (actually dist, dist1, dist2 and dist3) saw several
   imports of stuff like gzip, grep, diff, rcs, sort, tar, texinfo, pr, gdb,
   groff etc. Fro most of these, we had distinct branches later on. Also, non
   of the files conflict, so have 4 different dist branches with partial
   overlap makes no sense whatsoever.
*  vendor/games/dist had 4 useful commits only
*  vendor/unknown is a grab bag of stuff
*  vendor/unlabelled-1.1.1, ok whatever

## Before

Recording this as it is recorded in SVN results in this nonsense:

```

Of note is that e.g. gzip 1.1 was imported on the branch just fine, but the
update to 1.2.2 happened to head directly.

r16 was split into vendor/unknown and cvs2svn/branches/unlabeled-1.1.1 but then
merged wholesale into head with r17.

## After

We keep the misc-GNU branch for now. The cvs branch is an actual vendor branch
that we also keep around.
